  <h2>My Story:</h2>
  <div id="about-container">
    <div id="my-story">
      <p>I'm a Software Engineer with notable experience of 2.5 yrs with flutter development & cloud functionality. I'm always open to new ideas and projects.</p>
      <p>I worked as a Flutter Developer with Cloud Function expertise for a year at a software
      development company â€“ Cloudcraftz . My main responsibility was to develop and maintain
      mobile applications using Flutter framework and integrate them with backend services using
      Cloud Functions.
      During my tenure, I was involved in the development of several applications that weredeployed on both Android and iOS
      platforms. I also worked on integrating various third-party
      services such as Firebase, Google Maps, and Stripe.
      Apart from developing mobile applications, I also worked on creating serverless functions
      using Google Cloud Functions. These functions were used to perform various tasks such as
      sending push notifications, processing user data, and managing backend services.
      I collaborated closely with the design and product teams to ensure that the applications were
      intuitive and user-friendly. I also provided technical support to clients and resolved any
      issues that arose during the development process.
      Overall, my experience as a Flutter Developer with Cloud Function expertise was challenging
      and rewarding. It allowed me to expand my technical skills and work on innovative projects.that made a real impact on users' lives.</p>
